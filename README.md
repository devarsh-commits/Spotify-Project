I’m excited to share my latest project — a Spotify Clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

🔧 Key Features:

🎵 Sleek, responsive UI inspired by Spotify’s modern design

⚡ Real-time interactivity powered by vanilla JavaScript

📁 Dynamic rendering of music cards through JSON — making the app scalable and easy to update

🎚️ Custom audio controls (play/pause, seek, volume)

📱 Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop

This project helped me sharpen my front-end development skills, work with dynamic data rendering, and better understand UI/UX principles.
